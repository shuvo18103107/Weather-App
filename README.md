# Weather-App
In this repository  I build a weather app with a nice and clean designed user interface. The app will be able to communicate with a database what has a data from lots of cities around the world. This will happen via API calls. The data will appear on the screen while the background image and the weather icon will change as the weather changes in the searched city. For the usability it will show an error message in case of a wrong search. The app will also have an app icon to look more like a real application.  In this project I learned how to:
- fetch data from the Internet,
using API call,
- use an API,
- get current location with geolocation,
- manage states, use stateful class, 
- build clean layout,
- work with TextField widget, 
- use platform specific design,
- use asynchronous functions, 
- building user-friendly app with error handling,
- use the conditional operator,
- set the app icon in both platforms,
- build a basic app with Flutter.
